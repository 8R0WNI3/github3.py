1.2.0: unreleased
-----------------

This is a small release with some enhancements.

Features Added
``````````````

- Organization Invitations Preview API is now supported. This includes an
  additional ``Invitation`` object. This is the result of hard work by Hal
  Wine.

- A ``ShortLabel`` class was added to represent the shorter (description-less)
  representation of labels returned by the API.

- The branch protections API is now completely represented in github3.py.
