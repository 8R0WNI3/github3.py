1.2.0: unreleased
-----------------

This is a small release with some enhancements.

Features Added
``````````````

- Partial GitHub Apps support. We added the following:

  - ``GitHub.login_as_app`` to login using JWT as an Application

  - ``GitHub.login_as_app_installation`` to login using a token obtained from
    an App's JWT

  - ``GitHub.app`` to retrieve an application by its "slug"

  - ``GitHub.app_installation`` to retrieve a specific installation by its ID

  - ``GitHub.app_installations`` to retrieve all of an App's installations

  - ``GitHub.app_installation_for_organization`` to retrieve an organization's
    installation of an App

  - ``GitHub.app_installation_for_repository`` to retrieve an installation for
    a specific repository

  - ``GitHub.app_installation_for_user`` to retrieve an installation for a
    specific user

  - ``GitHub.authenticated_app`` to retrieve the metadata for a specific App

  - Not supported as of this release:

    - `Installations API`_

    - `List installations for user`_

    - `User-to-server OAuth access token`_

- Organization Invitations Preview API is now supported. This includes an
  additional ``Invitation`` object. This is the result of hard work by Hal
  Wine.

- A ``ShortLabel`` class was added to represent the shorter (description-less)
  representation of labels returned by the API.

- The branch protections API is now completely represented in github3.py.
